# Implement-Atoi
-------------------------------------------------
Online Python Challenges
-------------------------------------------------

Your task  is to implement the function atoi. The function takes a string(str) as argument and converts it to an integer and returns it.

Note: You are not allowed to use inbuilt function.

Example 1:

Input:
str = 123
Output: 123

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Example 2:

Input:
str = 21a
Output: -1
Explanation: Output is -1 as all
characters are not digit only.


Your Task:
Complete the function atoi() which takes a string as input parameter and returns integer value of it. if the input string is not a numerical string then returns -1.
Note: Numerical strings are the string where either every character is in between 0-9 or where the first character is '-' and the rest all characters are in between 0-9.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|S|), |S| = length of string str.
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 ≤ length of S ≤ 10
